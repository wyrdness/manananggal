## Overview

The Manananggal is a terrifying creature from Filipino folklore, particularly prominent in the Visayas region. By day, it appears as a beautiful woman living a normal life. By night, it undergoes a horrific transformation: its upper torso separates from its lower body at the waist, growing bat-like wings that allow it to fly in search of prey.

The creature is especially feared for its predation on pregnant women, using its long, proboscis-like tongue to feed on unborn fetuses through roof thatch. The Manananggal can be killed by destroying its lower body while it is separated, typically by applying salt, garlic, or ash to prevent reconnection before sunrise.

⚠️ **Cultural Sensitivity**: This is a living Filipino folk tradition with deep cultural significance. Approach with respect and cultural awareness.
