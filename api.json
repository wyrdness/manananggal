      "summary": "A Filipino vampire-like creature that detaches its upper torso from its lower body at night, grows bat-like wings, and preys on pregnant women and sick people using its long proboscis tongue.",
      "full": "The Manananggal is a terrifying creature from Filipino folklore, particularly prominent in the Visayas region. By day, it appears as a beautiful woman living a normal life. By night, it undergoes a horrific transformation: its upper torso separates from its lower body at the waist, growing bat-like wings that allow it to fly in search of prey. The creature is especially feared for its predation on pregnant women, using its long, proboscis-like tongue to feed on unborn fetuses through roof thatch. The creature's name comes from 'tanggal' (to remove or separate), referring to its ability to detach its body. Its distinctive 'tik-tik' sound is said to work in reverse - louder when far away, softer when near, making it difficult for victims to judge their danger. The Manananggal can be killed by destroying its lower body while it is separated, typically by applying salt, garlic, or ash to prevent reconnection before sunrise."
